      <p>In the latest release, I&#39;ve added support for commit message and description suggestions via an integration with OpenAI. Commit looks at all of your changes, and feeds that into the machine with a bit of prompt-tuning to get back a commit message that does a surprisingly good job at describing the intent of your changes.</p>
      <p>It&#39;s also been a pretty helpful way to remind myself what the hell I was working on at the end of the day yesterday when I get back to my computer and realize I didn&#39;t commit any of my work.</p>
      <h3 id="-sparkleicon-improvements"><SparkleIcon /> Improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added commit message and description suggestions powered by OpenAI</li>
        <li>Fixed race condition that could sometimes leave you in a broken rebase state</li>
        <li>Improved active project detection to try and ignore file changes triggered by the system instead of the user</li>
        <li>Fixed bug that sometimes reported the wrong number of changed files</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I&#39;ve added support for creating per-project <code>.commitrc</code> files that override your global settings for that particular project. Went with YAML for these because personally I&#39;m sick of quoting keys in JSON all the time, or accidentally leaving in a trailing comma.</p>
      <h3 id="-sparkleicon-improvements"><SparkleIcon /> Improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added per-project <code>.commitrc</code> configuration files</li>
        <li>Improved performance when working with projects with large binary files</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug that could cause Commit to crash when autocommitting after deleting a recently active branch</li>
      </ul>

    <Article id="x" date={new Date()} title="Dark mode support">
      <p><img src="@/images/dark-mode.png" alt="" /></p>
      <h2 id="dark-mode-support-date-2023-03-06t00-00z-">Dark mode support <time dateTime='x'>x</time></h2>
      <p>I released this thing last week hoping a couple of people would say &quot;awesome job&quot; and make me feel good about what I&#39;d built but instead I just got a ton of people shaming me on Twitter for being such a horrible person for only shipping a light UI.</p>
      <h3 id="-sparkleicon-improvements"><SparkleIcon /> Improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added dark mode support</li>
        <li>Improved input field responsiveness when writing a commit message in a project with a large number of changed files</li>
        <li>Made keyboard shortcut for opening the Commit window customizable</li>
        <li>Deleted my Twitter account</li>
      </ul>

    <Article id="x" date={new Date()} title="Commit v0.1.0">
      <p><img src="@/images/first-release.png" alt="" /></p>
      <h2 id="commit-v0-1-0-date-2023-03-03t00-00z-">Commit v0.1.0 <time dateTime='x'>x</time></h2>
      <p>Commit is a command palette-style Git client you can pull up from anywhere with a keyboard shortcut that makes it really easy to commit your work. It uses the &quot;last modified&quot; timestamp of the files in all of your projects to automatically know which project you&#39;re in the middle of working on, so any time you pull up the UI it&#39;s already got the right project selected â€” you just have to type your commit message, hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> and your changes are captured.</p>
      <p>I&#39;d be lying if I really thought this was that useful but I was looking for an excuse to learn macOS development and here we are. It&#39;s open source at least so maybe you can find something interesting in the code even if the app itself is a total waste of hard drive space.</p>
